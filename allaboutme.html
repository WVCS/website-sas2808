        <p1> Hi I My name is Sujata Savani, but you can call me Suju! I am 15 years old and was born on <br> September 28, 2008 in Redwood City California. After I was born I moved to Rockville Maryland. <br> I lived there for 1 year, then after my sister was born we moved to Gaithursburg Maryland and lived <br> there for 13 years. My dad intereviwed for a job here in San Diego which is what uprooted me and my family <br> and caused us to come here. I moved to San Diego on July 8, 2023. Some things I enjoy doing are drawing, <br> biking, making jewlery, watching TV, spending time with family, playing games, and traveling. I have been swimming <br> for 11 years of my life and I was a part of Westviews junior varsity swim team this year. Some classes I took in the <br> 2023-2024 school year are, Integrated III Math, ENS 1-2, Human Body Systems, Honors English, Spanish 3-4, <br> Ap Computer Science Principles, Chemistry, ENS 1-2. One of the classes I really enjoyed was Human Body <br> Systems. We got to learn about the fascinating human body by running cool experiments and labs.
